# N11 Search Performance Test

## Project Content
This project is designed to measure the search performance of the n11 website using JMeter by reading data from a CSV file. A sample HTML report output has been included in the project. 
Additionally, if you want to generate the report again, you can use the following command as an example: jmeter -n -t C:\Users\Salim\Desktop\n11SearchLoadTest.jmx -l C:\Users\Salim\Desktop\loadcase1.csv -e -o C:\Users\Salim\Desktop.
